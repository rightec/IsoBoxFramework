# IsoBoxFramework

Base framework project to realize a temperature controller on a generic device

@@@ Here comes from the following: 
Tools to be used â€“ free choice. Requirement : ensure that the temperature in a room is always between a min and max adjustable temperature. 
When temp is too low, start heating, when temp is too high start cooling. 
How: 
1- create a component in cpp + api's 
2- create needed test-cases using google test (stub, mock,..) 
3- code must be build with cmake 
4- code is available in a git repo

#### Base component class under test is isolatedBoxCmake (.cpp, .h)
This component depends on a PidController class and an IsoActuator class that manages a PWM used by PID This classes are not fully implemented. 
They are only a skeleton of a supposed full temperature controller device

@@@ The application simulates a data serialization from a supposed temperature sensor and give that data
to the PID controller of the base class that manages all temperature compensation (isolatedBoxCmake)

#### Project building by using Cmake File
IDE used Visual Studio 2019

# GOOGLE TEST CASE
The google test case environment it is archived in another repo: https://github.com/rightec/IsoBoxTestEnv

A test case folder (TestCase) will store the test file executed in order to keep link with the commit

# DOCUMENTS

A document folder will contain pdf file to show some implementation detail of the component
